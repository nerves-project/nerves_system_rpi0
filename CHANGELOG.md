# Changelog

This project does NOT follow semantic versioning. The version increases as
follows:

1. Major version updates are breaking updates to the build infrastructure.
   These should be very rare.
2. Minor version updates are made for every major Buildroot release. This
   may also include Erlang/OTP and Linux kernel updates. These are made four
   times a year shortly after the Buildroot releases.
3. Patch version updates are made for Buildroot minor releases, Erlang/OTP
   releases, and Linux kernel updates. They're also made to fix bugs and add
   features to the build infrastructure.

    would break code that manually adjusted the CPU frequency.
  * Programs that use OpenMP will run now. The OpenMP shared library
    (`libgomp.so`) was supplied by the toolchain, but not copied.

## v1.18.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2021.11 and OTP 24.2. If you have made a

  * [nerves_system_br v1.17.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.17.0)
  * [Buildroot 2021.08](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-September/622072.html)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.1](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.1.README)

## v1.16.2

This release updates Erlang/OTP from 24.0.3 to 24.0.5 and Buildroot from 2021.05
to 2021.05.1. Both of these are security/bug fix updates. This is expected to be
a safe upgrade from v1.16.1 for all users.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.16.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.16.1)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.0.5](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.0.5.README)

* Improvements
  * Support for the Adafruit Speaker Bonnet (See PR #214 for details)
  * Beta support for using a `runtime.exs` script for runtime configuration.
  * Added a `provision` task to the `fwup.config` to enable re-provisioning a
    MicroSD card without changing its contents.
  * Adds a default `/etc/sysctl.conf` that enables use of ICMP in Erlang. This
    requires `nerves_runtime v0.11.5` or later to automatically load the sysctl
    variables. With it using `:gen_udp` to send/receive ICMP will "just work".
    It also makes it easier to add other sysctl variables if needed.

## v1.16.1

This release updates Nerves Toolchains to v1.4.3 and OTP 24.0.3. It should be
safe for everyone to apply.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.16.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.16.1)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.0.3](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.0.3.README)
  * [nerves toolchains v1.4.3](https://github.com/nerves-project/toolchains/releases/tag/v1.4.3)

## v1.16.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2021.05 and OTP 24.0.2. If you have made a
custom system off this one, please review the `nerves_system_br v1.16.0` release
notes.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.16.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.16.0)
  * [Buildroot 2021.05](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-June/311946.html)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.0.2](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.0.2.README)

* Improvements
  * This release now contains debug symbols and includes the Build-ID in the
    ELF headers. This makes it easier to get stack traces from C programs. As
    before, the Nerves tooling strips all symbols from firmware images, so this
    won't make programs bigger.
  * Enable compile-time `wpa_supplicant` options to support WPA3, mesh
    networking, WPS and autoscan.
  * Add `core_freq=250` to the default `config.txt` so that Bluetooth can work
    out of the box. See [Raspberry Pi UART
    Config](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/uart.md)

## v1.15.1

This is a security/bug fix release that updates to Buildroot 2021.02.1 and OTP
23.3.1. It should be safe for everyone to apply.

* Improvements
  * espeak has been removed from the default install to trim 13 MB off the root
    filesystem

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.15.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.15.1)

## v1.15.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2021.02 and OTP 23.2.7. If you have made a
custom system off this one, please review the `nerves_system_br v1.15.0` release
notes.

The Nerves toolchain has also been updated to v1.4.2. This brings in Linux 4.14
headers to enable use of cdev and eBPF. This won't affect most users.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.15.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.15.0)
  * [Buildroot 2021.02](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-March/305168.html)

  * [nerves toolchains v1.4.2](https://github.com/nerves-project/toolchains/releases/tag/v1.4.2)

## v1.14.1

This is a patch release for v1.14.0 which fixes the ABI spec passed for zigler.

* Improvements
  * A few unused directories in `/etc` have been removed. These primarily were
    network initialization script directories that aren't used on Nerves, but
    were provided by default by Buildroot.

## v1.14.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2020.11.2, GCC 10.2 and OTP 23.2.4.

When migrating custom systems based on this one, please be aware of the
following important changes:

* There's a new `getrandom` syscall that is made early in BEAM startup. This
  blocks the BEAM before `rngd` can be started to provide entropy. The
  workaround is to start `rngd` from `erlinit`. See `erlinit.config`.
* Hardware float is enabled (`eabihf`). If you have pre-built binaries, you will
  need to compile them since previous `eabi` was used.
* The GCC 10.2.0 toolchain has a different name that calls out "nerves" as the
  vendor and the naming is now more consistent with other toolchain providers.
* Experimental support for tooling that requires more information about the
  target has been added. The initial support focuses on zigler.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br: bump to v1.14.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.14.4)
  * [Buildroot 2020.11.2](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-January/302574.html)

  * [Nerves toolchains 1.4.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/toolchains/releases/tag/v1.4.1)

## v1.13.3

This is a bug fix release and contains no major changes.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br: bump to v1.13.7](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.13.7)
  * [Erlang/OTP 23.1.5](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-23.1.5.README)

## v1.13.2

This release includes a patch release update to
[Buildroot 2020.08.2](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2020-November/296830.html).

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br: bump to v1.13.5](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.13.5)
  * [erlinit 1.9.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/erlinit/releases/tag/v1.9.0)

* Improvements
  * Switched source for built-in WiFi module firmware. This pulls in newer
    firmware versions that were found to fix issues on the Raspberry Pi 4. It
    may improve built-in WiFi on other Raspberry Pis.

## v1.13.1

The main change in this release is to bump the Linux kernel to 5.4. This follows
the kernel update in the Raspberry Pi OS.

If you have based a custom system off of this one, please inspect the
`nerves_defconfig` for WiFi firmware changes. WiFi firmware is no longer being
pulled from the `rpi-wifi-firmware` since that package is out of date.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br: bump to v1.13.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.13.4)
  * [Erlang/OTP 23.1.4](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-23.1.4.README)
  * [boardid 1.10.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/boardid/releases/tag/v1.10.0)

* Improvements
  * Enabled reproducible builds in Buildroot to remove some timestamp and build
    path differences in firmware images. This helps delta firmware updates.
  * The memory cgroup controller is no longer enabled by default. This was an
    upstream change. As a result, the memory cgroup directory is no longer
    mounted.

## v1.13.0

This release updates to [Buildroot
2020.08](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2020-September/290797.html) and OTP 23.1.1.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br: bump to v1.13.2](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.13.2)

  * [nerves 1.7.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves/releases/tag/v1.7.0)

* New features
  * Added support for updating the root filesystem using firmware patches.
    See the [firmware patch docs](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/experimental-features.html#content) for more information.

## v1.12.2

This release updates to [Buildroot
2020.05.1](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2020-July/287824.html)
and OTP 23.0.3 which are both bug fix releases.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br: bump to v1.12.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.12.4)
  * [Erlang/OTP 23.0.3](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-23.0.3.README)
  * [nerves_heart v0.3.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_heart/releases/tag/v0.3.0)

* New features
  * The `/data` directory now exists for storing application-specific data. It
    is currently a symlink to `/root`. Using `/data` will eventually be
    encouraged over `/root` even though currently there is no advantage. This
    change makes it possible to start migrating paths in applications and
    libraries.

* Fixes
  * Fixed old references to the `-Os` compiler flag. All C/C++ code will default
    to using `-O2` now.

## v1.12.1

* Fixes
  * Remove `nerves_system_linter` from hex package. This fixes mix dependency
    errors in projects that reference systems with different
    `nerves_system_linter` dependency specs.

## v1.12.0

This release updates the system to use Buildroot 2020.05 and Erlang/OTP 23.
Please see the respective release notes for updates and deprecations in both
projects for changes that may affect your application.

  * Erlang 22.3.1
  * erlinit 1.7.0 - tty initialization support
  * fwup 1.6.0 - xdelta3/VCDIFF patch support
  * Enable unixodbc so that Erlang's odbc application can be used in projects

## v1.11.0

This release updates Buildroot to 2020.02 and upgrades gcc from 8.3 to 9.2.
While this is a minor version bump due to the Buildroot release update, barring
advanced usage of Nerves, this is a straightforward update from v1.10.2.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.11.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.11.0)
  * linux 4.19.97 (raspberrypi-kernel_1.20200212-1 tag)
  * Erlang 22.2.8

## v1.10.2

* Fixes
  * This fixes a regression on OSX where the USB gadget Ethernet would
    incorrectly try to go into RNDIS mode and not work. Gadget Ethernet works
    with this fix on Linux and OSX. It also works on Windows with a driver
    installed. See the README.md for details.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.10.2](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.10.2)
  * Erlang 22.2.4

## v1.10.1

This release changes the behavior of the gadget port as well as the UART pins
on the GPIO header. The gadget driver has been changed to use g_ether. This
provides a more stable network connection at the expense of the virtual serial
port. Console access has been output to the UART. If you were using the UART
to connect to peripherals, you will need to disable the console.
See: https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/advanced-configuration.html#overwriting-files-in-the-boot-partition
for more information.

* Enhancements
  * Set `expand=true` on the application data partition. This will only take
    effect for users running the complete task, fwup will not expand application
    data partitions that exist during upgrade tasks.
  * linux: swap the cdc composite gadget for g_ether

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.10.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.10.1)

  * Add TAR option `--no-same-owner` to fix errors when untarring artifacts as
    the root user.
* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.7.2](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.7.2)

## v1.7.1

This release fixes a major issue with the gadget USB port where it would hang on
boot. If you have made a custom system or are overriding the `erlinit.config`
file in your project, please make sure that your `erlinit.config` has:

```text
-c null
-s "/usr/bin/nbtty --tty /dev/ttyGS0 --wait-input"
```

* Bug fixes
  * Fix regression with virtual serial port where it could cause the whole USB
    interface to hang.

* Improvements
  * Bump C compiler options to `-O2` from `-Os`. This provides a small, but
    measurable performance improvement (500ms at boot in a trivial project).

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.7.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.7.1)

## v1.7.0

This release bumps the Linux kernel to 4.19.25. This change had an impact on how
the WiFi regulatory database gets loaded into the kernel. Instead of building it
into the kernel as previously done, the kernel loads it on demand. This requires
that all WiFi drivers be built as kernel modules so that the database isn't
loaded before the root filesystem is mounted. If you made a custom system and
see boot errors about not being able to load the regulatory database, this is
the problem.

A known bug with the Raspberry Pi Zero USB gadget interface is that it sometimes
doesn't load on Linux systems. Moving the gadget drivers to kernel modules seems
to work around this but it takes longer to load the gadget interface.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.7.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.7.0)
  * Linux 4.19.25 with patches from the Raspberry Pi Foundation

  * Erlang 21.2.4
  * boardid 1.5.3

## v1.6.1

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.6.5](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.6.5)
  * Erlang 21.2.2
  * boardid 1.5.2
  * erlinit 1.4.9
  * OpenSSL 1.1.1a
  * Linux 4.14.89 with patches from the Raspberry Pi Foundation

* Enhancements
  * Moved boardid config from inside erlinit.config to /etc/boardid.config
  * Compile gpiomem into the Linux kernel
  * Enable pstore, an in-memory buffer that can capture logs, kernel
    oops and other information when unexpected reboots. The buffer can be
    recovered on the next boot where it can be inspected.

## v1.6.0

This pulls in a pending patch in Buildroot to update the version of
OpenSSL from 1.0.2 to 1.1.0h. This fixes what appears to be issues with
Erlang using OpenSSL engines. It also enables Erlang crypto algorithms
such as ed25519 that have been added in recent Erlang releases.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.6.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.6.1)
  * Erlang 21.2
* Added dependencies
  * wpa_passphrase
  * libp11 0.4.9

## v1.5.1

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.5.3](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.5.3)

## v1.5.0

This release updates the Linux kernel from 4.4 to 4.14.71.

* Enhancements
  * Added Alsa utils `aplay` and `amixer` for audio support.
  * Added `espeak` a speech synthesizer for text to audio.
  * Automatically reboot if the Linux kernel panics (defaults to a 10 second
    delay before the reboot)

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.5.2](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.5.2)
  * Linux 4.14.71 with patches from the Raspberry Pi Foundation
  * Erlang 21.0.9

## v1.4.0

This release contains various updates to provisioning variables and data.

**Host requirements**

Building firmware using this system requires `fwup` to be updated on your
host computer to at least `v1.2.5`. The target minimum version requirement
has not changed from `0.15.0`.

**Serial numbers**

Device serial numbers are now set using `NERVES_SERIAL_NUMBER` instead of
`SERIAL_NUMBER`. This is to reduce ambiguity on the source of the serial
by name spacing it along side other Nerves variables. The U-Boot environment
key has also changed from `serial_number` to `nerves_serial_number`. The
erlinit.config has been updated to provide backwards compatibility for setting
the hostname from the serial number by checking for `nerves_serial_number`
and falling back to `serial_number`.

**Custom provisioning**

Provisioning data is applied at the time of calling the `fwup` task `complete`.
The `complete` task is executed when writing the firmware to the target disk.
During this time, `fwup` will include the contents of a provisioning file
located at `${NERVES_SYSTEM}/images/fwup_include/provisioning.conf`. By default,
this file only sets `nerves_serial_number`. You can add additional provisioning
data by overriding the location of this file to include your own by setting
the environment variable `NERVES_PROVISIONING`. If you override this variable
you will be responsible for also setting `nerves_serial_number`.

* Updated dependencies

    of reverting to devices IDs built into the CPU or board.
  * It wasn't possible to enable QtWebEngine (needed for kiosk apps)

## v1.1.0

This release adds official support for provisioning serial numbers to devices.
Other information can be provisioned in a similar manner. See the README.md for
details.

  This fixes the call to otp_build so that it always uses Buildroot's version
  the autoconf tools.

## v0.20.0

Important: This image removes kernel log messages from the HDMI and UART ports.
They are now only available via `dmesg`. If you're debugging a boot hang, you
can re-enable prints by updating the cmdline.txt. See README.md.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v0.16.1-2017-11](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v0.16.1-2017-11)

* Bug fixes
  * Removed kernel logging from UART and HDMI to avoid interfering with other
    uses. They are rarely used on those ports.

* Enhancements
  * Reboot automatically if Erlang VM exits - This is consistent with other
    Nerves systems. See rootfs_overlay/etc/erlinit.config if undesired.
  * Start running nerves_system_linter to check for configuration errors.
  * Disable console blanking for HDMI to make it easier to capture error messages.
  * Automount the boot partition readonly at `/boot`
  * Support for reverting firmware.

    See [Reverting Firmware](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves_runtime/readme.html#reverting-firmware) for more info on reverting firmware.

    See [fwup-revert.conf](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_rpi/blob/master/fwup-revert.conf) for more information on how fwup handles reverting.

## v0.17.1

* Updated dependencies
  * nerves_system_br v0.13.7

## v0.17.0

This release contains an updated toolchain with Linux 4.1 Headers.
You will have to clean and compile any c/c++ code in your project and
dependencies. Failure to do so will result in an error when producing firmware.

* nerves_system_br v0.13.5
  * fwup 0.15.4

* Nerves toolchain v0.11.0

* New Features
  * Fix warnings for Elixir 1.5
  * Remove unused options from OTP 20 update
  * Per Buildroot convention, the rootfs-additions directory is being renamed
    to rootfs_overlay. A symlink is put in its place to avoid breaking any
    systems.
  * Enabled IPv6 Support in Linux kernel

## v0.16.0

* nerves_system_br v0.13.2
  * OTP 20
  * erlinit 1.1.3
  * fwup 0.15.3

* New features
  * Firmware updates verify that they're updating the right target. If the target
    doesn't say that it's an `rpi0` through the firmware metadata, the update
    will fail.
  * Added meta-misc and meta-vcs-identifier to the `fwup.conf` metadata for use
    by users and for the regression test framework

* Bug fixes
  * The `erlinit` update fixes a hang issue that occurs on reboots if nothing
    is connected to the USB virtual serial console.

## v0.15.0

* nerves_system_br v0.12.1
  * erlinit 1.1.1
  * fwup 0.15.0

* New features
  * The application data partition is now `ext4`. This greatly improves its
    robustness to corruption. Nerves.Runtime contains code to initialize it on
    first boot.
  * Firmware images now contain metadata that can be queried at runtime (see
    Nerves.Runtime.KV
  * Increased GPU memory to support Pi Camera V2

## v0.14.0

* nerves_system_br v0.12.0
  * Buildroot 2017.05
  * erlinit 1.1.0

* New features
  * pigpio is now available by default (enables near real-time use of gpios)

* Bug fixes
  * USB host/gadget mode selection doesn't seem to work on some non-Apple
    hardware. Host support has been disabled as a workaround. See
    [Issue 10](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_rpi0/issues/10) for details.

* Other changes
  * pi3-miniuart-bt overlay is enabled by default to give full speed UART access on GPIO pins

## v0.13.1

* nerves_system_br v0.11.1
  * erlinit 1.0.1 - contains fix for Erlang VM exit detection issue

## v0.13.0

The brcmfmac wireless driver is now built as a module, so you will need to load it. See [hello_wifi](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves-examples/tree/master/hello_wifi) for an example of WiFi module loading on application startup.

* nerves_system_br v0.11.0
  * erlinit 1.0
  * fwup 0.14.2
  * rpi-userland and rpi-firmware version bumps to correspond with Raspbian Linux 4.4 updates

## v0.12.0

This is the first official Raspberry Pi Zero system release. It was forked
off `nerves_system_rpi` so previous versions are from that project. Those
also work on the Zero, but without USB gadget mode or RPi Zero W WiFi
support.

* nerves_system_br v0.10.0
  * Buildroot 2017.02
  * Erlang/OTP 19.3

* New features
  * Upgraded the Linux kernel from 4.4.43 -> 4.4.50. Due to the coupling
    between the Linux kernel and rpi-firmware and possibly rpi-userland, if
    you have a custom system based off this, you should update your Linux
    kernel as well. (see `nerves_defconfig` changes)

## v0.11.0

* New features
  * Enabled USB_SERIAL and FTDI_SIO support. Needed for connecting with Arduino to the USB ports
  * Support for Nerves 0.5.0

## v0.10.0

* New features
  * Upgraded the Linux kernel to 4.4.43. This also removes the
    call to mkknlimg which is no longer needed.
  * Bump toolchain to use gcc 5.3 (previously using gcc 4.9.3)

## v0.9.1

* Bug Fixes
  * Loosen mistaken nerves dep on `0.4.0` to `~> 0.4.0`

## v0.9.0

This version switches to using the `nerves_package` compiler. This will
consolidate overall deps and compilers.

* Nerves.System.BR v0.8.1
  * Support for distillery
  * Support for nerves_package compiler

## v0.7.0

When upgrading to this version, be sure to review the updates to
nerves_defconfig if you have customized this system.

* nerves_system_br v0.7.0
  * Package updates
    * Buildroot 2016.08
    * Linux 4.4

## v0.6.1

* Package versions
  * Nerves.System.BR v0.6.1

* New features
  * All Raspberry Pi-specific configuration is now in this repository
  * Enabled SMP Erlang - even though the RPi Zero and Model B+ are
    single core systems, some NIFs require SMP Erlang.

## v0.6.0

* Nerves.System.BR v0.6.0
  * Package updates
    * Erlang OTP 19
    * Elixir 1.3.1
    * fwup 0.8.0
    * erlinit 0.7.3
    * bborg-overlays (pull in I2C typo fix from upstream)
  * Bug fixes
    * Synchronize file system kernel configs across all platforms

## v0.5.2

* Enhancements
  * Enabled USB Printer kernel mod. Needs to be loaded with `modprobe` to use
* Bug Fixes(raspberry pi)
  * Enabled multicast in linux config for rpi/rpi2/rpi3/ev3

## v0.5.1

* Nerves.System.BR v0.5.1
  * Bug Fixes(nerves-env)
    * Added include paths to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS
    * Pass sysroot to LDFLAGS

## v0.5.0

* Nerves.System.BR v0.5.0
  * New features
    * WiFi drivers enabled by default on RPi2 and RPi3
    * Include wireless regulatory database in Linux kernel by default
      on WiFi-enabled platforms. Since kernel/rootfs are read-only and
      coupled together for firmware updates, the normal CRDA/udev approach
      isn't necessary.
    * Upgraded the default BeagleBone Black kernel from 3.8 to 4.4.9. The
      standard BBB device tree overlays are included by default even though the
      upstream kernel patches no longer include them.
    * Change all fwup configurations from two step upgrades to one step
      upgrades. If you used the base fwup.conf files to upgrade, you no
      longer need to finalize the upgrade. If not, there's no change.
