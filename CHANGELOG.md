# Changelog

## v1.11.1

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.11.2](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.11.2)
  * Erlang 22.3.1
  * erlinit 1.7.0 - tty initialization support
  * fwup 1.6.0 - xdelta3/VCDIFF patch support
  * Enable unixodbc so that Erlang's odbc application can be used in projects

## v1.11.0

This release updates Buildroot to 2020.02 and upgrades gcc from 8.3 to 9.2.
While this is a minor version bump due to the Buildroot release update, barring
advanced usage of Nerves, this is a straightforward update from v1.10.2.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.11.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.11.0)
  * linux 4.19.97 (raspberrypi-kernel_1.20200212-1 tag)
  * Erlang 22.2.8

## v1.10.2

* Fixes
  * This fixes a regression on OSX where the USB gadget Ethernet would
    incorrectly try to go into RNDIS mode and not work. Gadget Ethernet works
    with this fix on Linux and OSX. It also works on Windows with a driver
    installed. See the README.md for details.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.10.2](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.10.2)
  * Erlang 22.2.4

## v1.10.1

This release changes the behavior of the gadget port as well as the UART pins
on the GPIO header. The gadget driver has been changed to use g_ether. This
provides a more stable network connection at the expense of the virtual serial
port. Console access has been output to the UART. If you were using the UART
to connect to peripherals, you will need to disable the console.
See: https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/advanced-configuration.html#overwriting-files-in-the-boot-partition
for more information.

* Enhancements
  * Set `expand=true` on the application data partition. This will only take
    effect for users running the complete task, fwup will not expand application
    data partitions that exist during upgrade tasks.
  * linux: swap the cdc composite gadget for g_ether

## v1.7.1

This release fixes a major issue with the gadget USB port where it would hang on
boot. If you have made a custom system or are overriding the `erlinit.config`
file in your project, please make sure that your `erlinit.config` has:

```text
-c null
-s "/usr/bin/nbtty --tty /dev/ttyGS0 --wait-input"
```

* Bug fixes
  * Fix regression with virtual serial port where it could cause the whole USB
    interface to hang.

* Improvements
  * Bump C compiler options to `-O2` from `-Os`. This provides a small, but
    measurable performance improvement (500ms at boot in a trivial project).

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.7.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.7.1)

## v1.7.0

This release bumps the Linux kernel to 4.19.25. This change had an impact on how
the WiFi regulatory database gets loaded into the kernel. Instead of building it
into the kernel as previously done, the kernel loads it on demand. This requires
that all WiFi drivers be built as kernel modules so that the database isn't
loaded before the root filesystem is mounted. If you made a custom system and
see boot errors about not being able to load the regulatory database, this is
the problem.

A known bug with the Raspberry Pi Zero USB gadget interface is that it sometimes
doesn't load on Linux systems. Moving the gadget drivers to kernel modules seems
to work around this but it takes longer to load the gadget interface.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.7.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.7.0)
  * Linux 4.19.25 with patches from the Raspberry Pi Foundation

  * Compile gpiomem into the Linux kernel
  * Enable pstore, an in-memory buffer that can capture logs, kernel
    oops and other information when unexpected reboots. The buffer can be
    recovered on the next boot where it can be inspected.

## v1.6.0

This pulls in a pending patch in Buildroot to update the version of
OpenSSL from 1.0.2 to 1.1.0h. This fixes what appears to be issues with
Erlang using OpenSSL engines. It also enables Erlang crypto algorithms
such as ed25519 that have been added in recent Erlang releases.

* Enhancements
  * Added Alsa utils `aplay` and `amixer` for audio support.
  * Added `espeak` a speech synthesizer for text to audio.
  * Automatically reboot if the Linux kernel panics (defaults to a 10 second
    delay before the reboot)

  * Linux 4.14.71 with patches from the Raspberry Pi Foundation
  * Erlang 21.0.9

## v1.4.0

This release contains various updates to provisioning variables and data.

**Host requirements**

Building firmware using this system requires `fwup` to be updated on your
host computer to at least `v1.2.5`. The target minimum version requirement
has not changed from `0.15.0`.

**Serial numbers**

Device serial numbers are now set using `NERVES_SERIAL_NUMBER` instead of
`SERIAL_NUMBER`. This is to reduce ambiguity on the source of the serial
by name spacing it along side other Nerves variables. The U-Boot environment
key has also changed from `serial_number` to `nerves_serial_number`. The
erlinit.config has been updated to provide backwards compatibility for setting
the hostname from the serial number by checking for `nerves_serial_number`
and falling back to `serial_number`.

**Custom provisioning**

Provisioning data is applied at the time of calling the `fwup` task `complete`.
The `complete` task is executed when writing the firmware to the target disk.
During this time, `fwup` will include the contents of a provisioning file
located at `${NERVES_SYSTEM}/images/fwup_include/provisioning.conf`. By default,
this file only sets `nerves_serial_number`. You can add additional provisioning
data by overriding the location of this file to include your own by setting
the environment variable `NERVES_PROVISIONING`. If you override this variable
you will be responsible for also setting `nerves_serial_number`.

  the autoconf tools.

## v0.20.0

Important: This image removes kernel log messages from the HDMI and UART ports.
They are now only available via `dmesg`. If you're debugging a boot hang, you
can re-enable prints by updating the cmdline.txt. See README.md.

* Updated dependencies

off `nerves_system_rpi` so previous versions are from that project. Those
also work on the Zero, but without USB gadget mode or RPi Zero W WiFi
support.

* nerves_system_br v0.10.0
  * Buildroot 2017.02
  * Erlang/OTP 19.3

* New features
  * Upgraded the Linux kernel from 4.4.43 -> 4.4.50. Due to the coupling
    between the Linux kernel and rpi-firmware and possibly rpi-userland, if
    you have a custom system based off this, you should update your Linux
    kernel as well. (see `nerves_defconfig` changes)

## v0.9.1

* Bug Fixes
  * Loosen mistaken nerves dep on `0.4.0` to `~> 0.4.0`

## v0.9.0

This version switches to using the `nerves_package` compiler. This will
consolidate overall deps and compilers.

* Nerves.System.BR v0.8.1
  * Support for distillery
  * Support for nerves_package compiler

    single core systems, some NIFs require SMP Erlang.

## v0.6.0

* Nerves.System.BR v0.6.0
  * Package updates
    * Erlang OTP 19
    * Elixir 1.3.1
    * fwup 0.8.0

  * New features
    * WiFi drivers enabled by default on RPi2 and RPi3
    * Include wireless regulatory database in Linux kernel by default
      on WiFi-enabled platforms. Since kernel/rootfs are read-only and
      coupled together for firmware updates, the normal CRDA/udev approach
      isn't necessary.
    * Upgraded the default BeagleBone Black kernel from 3.8 to 4.4.9. The
      standard BBB device tree overlays are included by default even though the
      upstream kernel patches no longer include them.
    * Change all fwup configurations from two step upgrades to one step
      upgrades. If you used the base fwup.conf files to upgrade, you no
      longer need to finalize the upgrade. If not, there's no change.
