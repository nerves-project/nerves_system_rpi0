## v1.0.0-rc.1

This release contains updates to Erlang and heart from `nerves_system_br` and
mostly cosmetic changes to this project. The trivial `.fw` files are no longer
created by CI scripts. If you've forked this project and are building systems
using CI, make sure to update your publish scripts.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.0.0-rc.2](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.2)

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v0.16.3](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v0.16.3)
  This fixes the call to otp_build so that it always uses Buildroot's version
  the autoconf tools.

## v0.20.0

Important: This image removes kernel log messages from the HDMI and UART ports.
They are now only available via `dmesg`. If you're debugging a boot hang, you
can re-enable prints by updating the cmdline.txt. See README.md.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v0.16.1-2017-11](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v0.16.1-2017-11)

* Bug fixes
  * Removed kernel logging from UART and HDMI to avoid interfering with other
    uses. They are rarely used on those ports.

* Enhancements
  * Reboot automatically if Erlang VM exits - This is consistent with other
    Nerves systems. See rootfs_overlay/etc/erlinit.config if undesired.
  * Start running nerves_system_linter to check for configuration errors.
  * Disable console blanking for HDMI to make it easier to capture error messages.
  * Automount the boot partition readonly at `/boot`
  * Support for reverting firmware.

    See [Reverting Firmware](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves_runtime/readme.html#reverting-firmware) for more info on reverting firmware.

    See [fwup-revert.conf](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_rpi/blob/master/fwup-revert.conf) for more information on how fwup handles reverting.

  This is required to pull in the e2fsprogs patch that's needed now that
  util-linux's uuid_generate function calls getrandom and can block
  indefinitely for the urandom pool to initialize

* Bug fixes
  * Use `nbtty` by default to fix tty hang issue

## v0.17.1

* Updated dependencies
  * nerves_system_br v0.13.7

## v0.17.0

This release contains an updated toolchain with Linux 4.1 Headers.
You will have to clean and compile any c/c++ code in your project and
dependencies. Failure to do so will result in an error when producing firmware.

* nerves_system_br v0.13.5
  * fwup 0.15.4

* Nerves toolchain v0.11.0

* New Features
  * Fix warnings for Elixir 1.5
  * Remove unused options from OTP 20 update
  * Per Buildroot convention, the rootfs-additions directory is being renamed
    to rootfs_overlay. A symlink is put in its place to avoid breaking any
    systems.
  * Enabled IPv6 Support in Linux kernel

## v0.16.0

* nerves_system_br v0.13.2
  * OTP 20
  * erlinit 1.1.3
  * fwup 0.15.3

* New features
  * Firmware updates verify that they're updating the right target. If the target
    doesn't say that it's an `rpi0` through the firmware metadata, the update
    will fail.
  * Added meta-misc and meta-vcs-identifier to the `fwup.conf` metadata for use
    by users and for the regression test framework

* Bug fixes
  * The `erlinit` update fixes a hang issue that occurs on reboots if nothing
    is connected to the USB virtual serial console.

## v0.15.0

* nerves_system_br v0.12.1
  * erlinit 1.1.1
  * fwup 0.15.0

* New features
  * The application data partition is now `ext4`. This greatly improves its
    robustness to corruption. Nerves.Runtime contains code to initialize it on
    first boot.
  * Firmware images now contain metadata that can be queried at runtime (see
    Nerves.Runtime.KV
  * Increased GPU memory to support Pi Camera V2

## v0.14.0

* nerves_system_br v0.12.0
  * Buildroot 2017.05
  * erlinit 1.1.0

* New features
  * pigpio is now available by default (enables near real-time use of gpios)

* Bug fixes
  * USB host/gadget mode selection doesn't seem to work on some non-Apple
    hardware. Host support has been disabled as a workaround. See
    [Issue 10](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_rpi0/issues/10) for details.

* Other changes
  * pi3-miniuart-bt overlay is enabled by default to give full speed UART access on GPIO pins

## v0.13.1

* nerves_system_br v0.11.1
  * erlinit 1.0.1 - contains fix for Erlang VM exit detection issue

## v0.13.0

The brcmfmac wireless driver is now built as a module, so you will need to load it. See [hello_wifi](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves-examples/tree/master/hello_wifi) for an example of WiFi module loading on application startup.

* nerves_system_br v0.11.0
  * erlinit 1.0
  * fwup 0.14.2
  * rpi-userland and rpi-firmware version bumps to correspond with Raspbian Linux 4.4 updates

## v0.12.0

This is the first official Raspberry Pi Zero system release. It was forked
off `nerves_system_rpi` so previous versions are from that project. Those
also work on the Zero, but without USB gadget mode or RPi Zero W WiFi
support.

* nerves_system_br v0.10.0
  * Buildroot 2017.02
  * Erlang/OTP 19.3

* New features
  * Upgraded the Linux kernel from 4.4.43 -> 4.4.50. Due to the coupling
    between the Linux kernel and rpi-firmware and possibly rpi-userland, if
    you have a custom system based off this, you should update your Linux
    kernel as well. (see `nerves_defconfig` changes)

## v0.11.0

* New features
  * Enabled USB_SERIAL and FTDI_SIO support. Needed for connecting with Arduino to the USB ports
  * Support for Nerves 0.5.0

## v0.10.0

* New features
  * Upgraded the Linux kernel to 4.4.43. This also removes the
    call to mkknlimg which is no longer needed.
  * Bump toolchain to use gcc 5.3 (previously using gcc 4.9.3)

## v0.9.1

* Bug Fixes
  * Loosen mistaken nerves dep on `0.4.0` to `~> 0.4.0`

## v0.9.0

This version switches to using the `nerves_package` compiler. This will
consolidate overall deps and compilers.

* Nerves.System.BR v0.8.1
  * Support for distillery
  * Support for nerves_package compiler

## v0.7.0

When upgrading to this version, be sure to review the updates to
nerves_defconfig if you have customized this system.

* nerves_system_br v0.7.0
  * Package updates
    * Buildroot 2016.08
    * Linux 4.4

## v0.6.1

* Package versions
  * Nerves.System.BR v0.6.1

* New features
  * All Raspberry Pi-specific configuration is now in this repository
  * Enabled SMP Erlang - even though the RPi Zero and Model B+ are
    single core systems, some NIFs require SMP Erlang.

## v0.6.0

* Nerves.System.BR v0.6.0
  * Package updates
    * Erlang OTP 19
    * Elixir 1.3.1
    * fwup 0.8.0
    * erlinit 0.7.3
    * bborg-overlays (pull in I2C typo fix from upstream)
  * Bug fixes
    * Synchronize file system kernel configs across all platforms

## v0.5.2

* Enhancements
  * Enabled USB Printer kernel mod. Needs to be loaded with `modprobe` to use
* Bug Fixes(raspberry pi)
  * Enabled multicast in linux config for rpi/rpi2/rpi3/ev3

## v0.5.1

* Nerves.System.BR v0.5.1
  * Bug Fixes(nerves-env)
    * Added include paths to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS
    * Pass sysroot to LDFLAGS

## v0.5.0

* Nerves.System.BR v0.5.0
  * New features
    * WiFi drivers enabled by default on RPi2 and RPi3
    * Include wireless regulatory database in Linux kernel by default
      on WiFi-enabled platforms. Since kernel/rootfs are read-only and
      coupled together for firmware updates, the normal CRDA/udev approach
      isn't necessary.
    * Upgraded the default BeagleBone Black kernel from 3.8 to 4.4.9. The
      standard BBB device tree overlays are included by default even though the
      upstream kernel patches no longer include them.
    * Change all fwup configurations from two step upgrades to one step
      upgrades. If you used the base fwup.conf files to upgrade, you no
      longer need to finalize the upgrade. If not, there's no change.
