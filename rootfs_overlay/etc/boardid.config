# Please consider using an ATECCx08 or NervesKey rather than storing serial
# numbers in U-Boot environment blocks. Override this file in your project's
# rootfs_overlay directory and uncomment the following line if you go this
# route:
# -b nerves_key -f /dev/i2c-1

# Uncomment to use the Raspberry Pi's preprogrammed WiFi MAC address as the
# serial number.
# -b rpi_wlan0

# Read the serial number from the U-boot environment block. The variable
# "nerves_serial_number" is the desired variable to use. "serial_number" is
# checked as a backup.
-b uboot_env -u nerves_serial_number
-b uboot_env -u serial_number

# Last resort: use 4 digits of the RPi's unique ID as the serial number
-b rpi -n 4
