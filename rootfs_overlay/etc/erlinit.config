# a time.

# There's a call to getrandom(2) when loading the crypto NIF. Currently, it's
# loaded before nerves_runtime can start rngd and provide sufficient entropy to
# the kernel. This means genrandom(2) blocks the BEAM, and it can block the it
# sufficiently long to trigger a hardware watchdog to reboot. The workaround is
# to start rngd here.

# Specify the user and group IDs for the Erlang VM

#--gid 200

# Uncomment to ensure that the system clock is set to at least the Nerves
# System's build date/time. If you enable this, you'll still need to use NTP or
# another mechanism to set the clock, but it won't be decades off.
#--update-clock

# Uncomment to hang the board rather than rebooting when Erlang exits
# NOTE: Do not enable on production boards
#--hang-on-exit

# Change the graceful shutdown time. If 10 seconds isn't long enough between
# calling "poweroff", "reboot", or "halt" and :init.stop/0 stopping all OTP
# applications, enable this option with a new timeout in milliseconds.
#--graceful-shutdown-timeout 15000

# Optionally run a program if the Erlang VM exits
#--run-on-exit /bin/sh

# Enable UTF-8 filename handling in Erlang and custom inet configuration

# Mount the application partition (run "man fstab" for field names)
# NOTE: This must match the location in the fwup.conf. If it doesn't the system
#       will probably still work fine, but you won't get shell history since
#       shoehorn/nerves_runtime can't mount the application filesystem before
#       the history is loaded. If this mount fails due to corruption, etc.,
#       nerves_runtime will auto-format it. Your applications will need to handle
#       initializing any expected files and folders.
