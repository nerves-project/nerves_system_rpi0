# NOTES:
# 1. Kernel messages are output via the UART pins.
#    serial0 is magically replaced with ttyAMA0 or ttyS0 depending on the
#    serial port configuration in config.txt.
# 2. To output kernel messages over HDMI, add
#    "console=tty1 fbcon=scrollback:1024k consoleblank=0"
#    https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/cmdline-txt.md
# 3. If you're experimenting with kernel commandline parameters, it's easist
#    to modify this file on the MicroSD card via your development computer. To
#    make changes permanent, you'll need to override the fwup.conf.
